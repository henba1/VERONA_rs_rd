#
# Optional: global input box constraint for the perturbation region seen by SDP-CROWN.
# This should only be enabled when the inputs that reach the verifier are known to live in a fixed box, e.g. [0.0, 1.0]
# for unnormalized image datasets such as the JAIR MNIST/CIFAR-10 models. If preprocessing normalizes or otherwise
# rescales the inputs (for example to [-1, 1] or using dataset mean/std), make sure the bounds below match the actual
# range after preprocessing, or leave this unset to disable the box constraint.
#
# To enable, uncomment and set the two endpoints [lower_bound, upper_bound]. The default (when commented out) is to
# disable the global box constraint and use only the L2-ball perturbation.
